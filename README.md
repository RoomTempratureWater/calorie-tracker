<h2>🤖 How It Works</h2>

The **Fitness Agent** combines cutting-edge AI and backend tools to deliver a smart calorie-tracking experience:

- **Hugging Face Inference API** – Handles natural language queries, understands meal descriptions, and extracts nutritional insights.  
- **LangChain** – Powers the agent logic by chaining multiple tools, enabling reasoning, database interaction, and meal plan suggestions.  
- **RAG with ChromaDB** – Uses retrieval-augmented generation to fetch relevant nutritional context and user history before responding, making the agent more accurate and personalized.  
- **Supabase + PostgreSQL** – Securely stores user meal data and calorie logs, enabling historical tracking and analytics.  
- **FastAPI** – Provides a fast, clean API layer to interact with the AI agent.
